Welcome to the Badroid project !

The application called badroid, Body Air Drum for android, is an evolution of
an existing project: github.com/honnet/BAD

The basical idea is to be able to wirelessly trigger sounds using sensors on
the body. For the moment, we use BAD with a computer in which a software can
receive MIDI orders.

This project evolution allows the use of an android device instead of a
computer to trigger the sounds.

For any question or suggestion, feel free to contact us !
Enjoy ;)
